# John's Tech Blog 101 

## Week 14 Challenge

---
## *Description:* 

The tech blog project was created to develop a content management system while following a MVC(Model View Controller)architectural structure. This blog would allow users to publish blog posts and post comments to other blogs too. 

## *Process:*

The tech blog application was built using some starter code and express-handlebars package. A notable feature is utilized with bcrypt for password hashing. The major point of focus is the structure of the folders which follow the MVC style. This gives the developers a specific way to organize and move data. Also worth noting the use of Sequelize as the object relational mapper that makes working with MySQL databases easier.

### Summary: 

This was a chellenging project and although the models were completed I could not figure out the routes in time. I did find the MVC paradigm to work well as a guide. Also, I can understand why frameworks like React were created when compared to Handlebars. This may be a simple implementation for the right project.
