# John's Tech Blog 101 

## Week 14 Challenge

## *Description:* 

This application was created to give the user a way to write and save basic notes. This was the first attempt at using Express.js for the backend. The overall design is very simple and intended for quick note taking. 

## *Process:*

The tech blog application was built using some starter code with a traditional front end(HTML, CSS). The only framework used is Bootstrap via a CDN link. 

A notable feature is the ability to save your notes for later use.

The images here represents an example of the notes that were taken using the app. You will notice that you can give your notes titles and type your notes in the body below the title section.
